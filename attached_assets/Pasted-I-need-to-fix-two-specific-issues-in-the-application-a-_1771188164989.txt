I need to fix two specific issues in the application: a UI overflow bug and a functional API trigger bug.1. UI Layout Fix (Mobile Responsiveness):Issue: The navigation tabs ('Dashboard', 'For You', 'All Metrics') were partially fixed, but now the 'Uploads' button bleeds outside the canvas border on mobile.Fix: In the tabs container (likely in client/src/components/Dashboard.tsx), apply flex-wrap: wrap to the parent container so buttons stack on small screens, OR wrap the entire tab-bar in a scrollable container using Tailwind classes overflow-x-auto and whitespace-nowrap. Ensure the 'Uploads' button is contained within the max-w-full padding of the parent.2. Google Places API Logic Fix:Issue: The 'Today' and 'Discover Something New' buttons correctly trigger map renders. However, the 'Tomorrow' and 'Day After' buttons do not yield a Google Maps rendering when clicked, even if they update the UI state.Fix: Locate the event handlers for these buttons. Ensure that clicking 'Tomorrow' or 'Day After' triggers the exact same fetch or search function used by the 'Today' button.State Check: If using React, ensure the selectedDate state is a dependency in the useEffect hook that calls the Google Places API. The map must re-center or re-render markers whenever the date selection changes."Key Files to Target in your RepoTo ensure Replit doesn't get lost, you can point it toward these specific files:FeatureFile Path (Likely)What to look forUploads Buttonclient/src/components/Dashboard.tsxThe <button> or <a> tag for "Uploads" inside the flex container.Tab Overflowclient/src/components/Navigation.tsxThe parent div holding the tabs; needs overflow-hidden or flex-wrap.API Buttonsclient/src/pages/Home.tsxThe onClick functions for the date toggles.Map Renderingclient/src/components/MapContainer.tsxThe logic that clears and sets new markers on the Google Map canvas.Why the "Uploads" button is still bleedingEven if you fixed the other tabs, the "Uploads" button is likely the last element in a flex-row. Without a "Wrap" command, the browser tries to keep everything in one line, forcing the last element (Uploads) off the screen. By adding flex-wrap, you tell the browser: "If you run out of room, move the Uploads button to the next line."
